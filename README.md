In 2022, everything is rapidly digitizing. Technology plays a crucial role in every part of our lives. Every day, new types of systems get born to simplify some part of our lives. However, niche problems such as managment systems for organizations don't seem to be technologically very successful. According to our survey for the case in point, there is no portable and user-friendly mobile application which exists for old age home management.

To solve this problem, we are introducing *Angel* ❤️

Angel is a portable, user-friendly and administrative application which allows old age homes to break from traditional routines of keeping a logbook and doing everything manually. This application automates most of the manual work and allows for efficient searching through data.
